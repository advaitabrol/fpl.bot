how I want to use the team data
Make a "stat" that records how well each team has historically performed against every other team
- each team would have 19-20 stats, one for every other team in the league 
- takes into acount record and also degree of each loss and win, like was it scraped or was there 
a big score differential 

What would this stat look like total goals / total games which is
(goals scored - goals conceded) / (total num of games)
- take into account trajecotry, how the score has changed 
- stat: goals scored - goals conceded for every season
- observe how that has changed for every season
