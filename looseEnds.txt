Chronological Hypothetical Road map for fpl.bot 

FPL TEAM PARAMS
2 gk, 1 has to start
5 def, 3-5 have to start
5 mids, 2-5 have to start
3 att, 1-3 have to start

Restructure fixture difficulties
    - Have it organized season by season
    - Add holistic approach taking into acount overall home and away performance against everyone not just those specific teams
    - That would be a seperate difficulty rating so eaach team ahas 2 home and 2 away difficulties 
    - Add cummulative bi-seasonal approach ( starting at 2022-23)
        Uses the data for 2021-22
        then 2022-23 uses the previous data + first half of season, then calculate the same thing using the second half 
Server to host data and be able to access them
Host machine learning trianing model

Clean data
    - We kind of already have data in a very organized way for each player 
    - Make it so that when a player is input into the 11 the user wants to rate, their data is easy
    pull and run 


what we have
    - data and algo to predict expected points
    - using that data we have buit an algo to predict optimal team for the following 3 weeks
        - this also works as our wild card transfer because you would want to 
          wild card to the optimal team
    - We have made the transfer suggestions algo

features we still need
    - reorganize data, get rid of unnecessary data and clean it up a bit
    - be able to pull current data such as updates on injuries and new stats for players and teams
        - We need to organize the scheduling for re-calling the function to get the availability,
          also need to organize where this info saves to so that the algo getting predicted points
          can easily read it
    - update team difficulties bi-seasonaly with the most recent games having stronger weights
    - update player prices every...?

Figure out back-end
    - Code it using Flask
    - What is the input data going to look like?
    - How do we host our algorithms so that when a front-end command is chosen the back-end 
      responds accordingly?

Design UI 
    - Code it w react
    - Design layout
