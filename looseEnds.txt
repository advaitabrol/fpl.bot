Chronological Hypothetical Road map for fpl.bot 

FPL TEAM PARAMS
2 gk, 1 has to start
5 def, 3-5 have to starting
2 mids, 3-5 have to start
3 att, 1-3 have to start

Ok now I want to make an algorithm based on the information within those files. I want to build a team of players which maximizes expected points for the upcoming gameweek. There are also specific details which we must consider. The entire team is made up of 11 starting players and 4 substitutes, one of the substitutes must be a GK. In each team there must be 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders, and 3 attackers. Only the starting 11 contribute towards a teams points, so none of the expected points of the players on the bench contribute to the total expected points of a team. Of the starting 11, there must be one goalkeeper, at least 3 must be defenders, at least 3 must be midfielders, and at least 1 must be an attacker. The total cost of the entire team, starters and bench players, cannot exceed 100. Since the bench players do not contribute points, it is better to allocate the majority of the money to the starters. 


Restructure fixture difficulties
    - Have it organized season by season
    - Add holistic approach taking into acount overall home and away performance against everyone not just those specific teams
    - That would be a seperate difficulty rating so eaach team ahas 2 home and 2 away difficulties 
    - Add cummulative bi-seasonal approach ( starting at 2022-23)
        Uses the data for 2021-22
        then 2022-23 uses the previous data + first half of season, then calculate the same thing using the second half 
Server to host data and be able to access them
Host machine learning trianing model

Clean data
    - We kind of already have data in a very organized way for each player 
    - Make it so that when a player is input into the 11 the user wants to rate, their data is easy
    pull and run 

Make algorithm so that 



Algo for optimal team for the week
